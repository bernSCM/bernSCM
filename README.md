# BernSCM v1.0
The Bern Simple Climate Model (BernSCM) is a free open source reimplementation of a reduced form carbon cycle-climate model which has been used widely in previous scientific work and IPCC assessments.  
BernSCM represents the carbon cycle and climate system with a small set of equations for the heat and carbon budget, the parametrization of major nonlinearities, and the substitution of complex component systems with impulse response functions (IRF). 
The IRF approach allows cost-efficient yet accurate substitution of detailed parent models of climate system components with near linear behaviour.
Illustrative simulations of scenarios from previous multi-model studies show that BernSCM is broadly representative of the range of the climate-carbon cycle response simulated by more complex and detailed models.
Model code (in Fortran) was written from scratch with transparency and extensibility in mind, and is provided as open source.
BernSCM makes scientifically sound carbon cycle-climate modeling available for many applications.
Supporting up to decadal timesteps with high accuracy, it is suitable for studies with high computational load, and for coupling with, e.g., Integrated Assessment Models (IAM). Further applications include climate risk assessment in a business, public, or educational context, and the estimation of CO2 and climate benefits of emission mitigation options.

See the file BernSCM_manual(.pdf) for instructions on the use of the program.
